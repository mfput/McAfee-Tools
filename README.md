# McAfee-Tools
McAfee once had a large amount of free security tools you could download from their website. Unfortunately, most have since been removed. Here is a small collect I happened to have downloaded before they were taken down. <br/>
If I am violating any copyright laws, let me know and I will take these down. :/ <br/> <br/>
Tools include: bintext303, dumpautocomplete, fileinsight, filewatch, ForensicToolKit20, fport, galleta, nlast30, pasco, patchit, rifiuti, saveinfo, showin, and vision.
